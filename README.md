### <a name="overview"></a>## **Overview** ðŸ”Ž
This project focuses on automating CRUD operations for JSON files, making it easy to manage and manipulate data. It offers a user-friendly interface for performing essential actions on JSON files, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.
#### **Key Features** 
- **Dynamic Schema Handling:** Define table schemas using JSON files and dynamically generate CRUD operations.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems.
- **Effortless Setup:** Use provided batch files for Windows or simple commands for other OS to set up the project quickly.
- **Automatic Frontend Setup:** Automatically creates a frontend codebase in the public/JsonCRUD directory.
#### **Technologies Used** 
- **Node.js:** Leveraging the power of JavaScript on the server-side.
- **Express.js:** A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework for building robust APIs.
- **SQLite:** A lightweight, file-based database for efficient data storage.
- **npm:** The package manager for Node.js used for installing project dependencies.

added support for reference or foreign key of the database, and tested it with 320 in sqlite

in kcode config.json is keep in kcode root for much more cleaner look of the code


for mock testing the end points:

visual studio code extensions, helpfull :

for est client or http calling

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client

code runner for executing batch files and js files

https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner


for Backend :

root : bin folder the code is generated from 

when running the file from kcode/Backend.js

for Database :

root : KData/JSON folder the code is generated from 

when running the file from kcode/Database.js

it takes the configuration file ( config.json )

and it takes the data path also from that file only

for Database 
Mysql dosent have a datatype named NUMBER

We have covered the below datatypes

STRING
INTEGER
NUMBER ( converted to INTEGER )
DATE

Databases covered

Flat JSON
SQLite
Mysql
Postgres
MongoDB

errors can occur for mysql2 npm package for python
sqlite3 npm also error can come

for developers to enjoy this repo

1. run KCode/Backend.js
2. run KCode/Database.js
3. npm run build (this will generate the frontend files from the json schema referred in KCode/Config.json : DataPk)
